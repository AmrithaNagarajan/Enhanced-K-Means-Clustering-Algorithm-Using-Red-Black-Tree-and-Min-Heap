# Enhanced K-Means Clustering Algorithm Using Red Black Tree and Min-Heap
This is inspired from a IACSIT conference paper. Check the paper here-https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cNYMiOoSK8oA0z0zK7iqwzQLnhy1WUl/view?usp=sharing
This is implemented in Python.
Here we have teken a very simple data set called Mall Customer Segementation.
Using Red Black tree and Min Heap instead of a arrays for KNN algorithm greatly reduces computational cost in finding the number of clusters.
